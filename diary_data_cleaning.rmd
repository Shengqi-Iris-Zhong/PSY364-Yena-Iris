Randi's cleaning:

remove anyone with 
(problems > 1) | (problems == 1 & !is.na(partID_given)) 

other problematic cases or IDs to filter out completely: 
145, 1266, 1278, 1282, 1302, partID == R_1fiPEJydpvuaEEs, R_1jV9NyWEbelB76s,R_1PTxhk4207mTHAb, R_27kuznipTrWICLB, R_ODPL8q3q4Shtvr3, 2800

other problematic cases to fix due to participant error:

887 say Tues but change to Mon
894 is day 8 but it gets coded as day 1
